# Handwriting OCR Project

This project implements an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) system for analyzing handwritten text snippets. The goal is to accurately detect and extract text from handwritten samples, providing confidence scores for each recognition.

## Technical Approach & Reasoning

### Why Two OCR Engines?

1. **EasyOCR**
   * Modern deep learning approach
   * Better suited for handwriting variation
   * More configurable parameters
   * Higher accuracy potential
   * Slower processing speed
2. **Tesseract**
   * Industry standard baseline
   * Faster processing
   * Good for comparison
   * Less accurate with handwriting
